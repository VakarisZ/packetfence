//== UI Development recipes

To start an `webpack-dev-server` instance for PacketFence admin GUI, follow these steps:

1. Point [command]`webpack-dev-server` to an already running PacketFence API by setting an
`VUE_APP_API_SOCKET_ADDRESS` environment variable.
For example, [command]`export VUE_APP_API_SOCKET_ADDRESS=localhost:1443`

2. Run [command]`cd ./html/pfappserver/root`

3. Run [command]`npm run serve`

You should now have a running instance `webpack-dev-server` on port 8081.
