//== UI Development recipes

To start an `webpack-dev-server` instance for PacketFence admin GUI, follow these steps:

1. Point [command]`webpack-dev-server` to an already running PacketFence API by modifying the `proxy` property in `html/pfappserver/root/vue.config.js`

2. Run [command]`cd ./html/pfappserver/root`

3. Run [command]`npm run serve`

You should now have a running instance `webpack-dev-server` on port 8081.
